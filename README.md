# The Effectiveness of a Web-Based Scheduled Reminder System

This is a minimalist demo site for the research project. It includes an interactive "Live Preview" where users can enter a task, choose a time, and set a simulated reminder.

How to try locally:

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Use the Live Preview section to set and simulate reminders.

Files:

- `index.html` — main page
- `styles.css` — small custom styles
- `app.js` — demo logic

Notes:

- Uses Tailwind Play CDN for styling and Google Fonts for `Inter`.
